echo "‚úÖ 1. JWT-Based Authentication System"
echo "   - Secure token-based authentication with Argon2 password hashing"
echo "   - Role-based access control (RBAC) with admin/user roles"
echo "   - Configurable token expiry and session management"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 2. Enhanced Plugin Security"
echo "   - Mandatory SHA256 hash verification (no bypasses in production)"
echo "   - Plugin size limits and extension validation"
echo "   - Hot-reload with security constraints"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 3. Julia Sandbox Hardening"
echo "   - Comprehensive AST validation preventing dangerous code execution"
echo "   - Forbidden function blocking (system calls, file ops, network access)"
echo "   - Expression depth limits and module access restrictions"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 4. Advanced Rate Limiting & Request Security"
echo "   - Configurable rate limiting (100 requests/minute default)"
echo "   - Request size limits (5MB default, reduced from 10MB)"
echo "   - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, XSS protection)"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 5. Network Security Hardening"
echo "   - CORS disabled by default with restrictive origins"
echo "   - Security-first configuration defaults"
echo "   - Resource limits (30s execution timeout, 512MB memory limit)"
